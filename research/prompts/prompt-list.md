## Main prompts

### Refined system prompt

```
from now on whenever i paste into a prompt, refine it into a more meaningful prompt that better achieves the end goal. put it in markdown, don't write anything else outside of it.
```

## Summarize prompt

### Origin

```
Usually, when you don't know what components a github project consists of, what kind of prompt should you write so that an LLM model (like claude or chatgpt for example) can help you understand the project structure and code flow? Put the answer prompt in markdown and don't put it in quotes, don't write anything outside of it.
```

### Refined version

```

What components does this GitHub project consist of, and how do they contribute to the overall structure and code flow? Provide a detailed explanation of the projectâ€™s structure, including directories, key files, and their roles. Highlight any relationships or dependencies between components, and explain how the code executes or interacts step-by-step. If the project includes documentation, point out where I can find more details.
