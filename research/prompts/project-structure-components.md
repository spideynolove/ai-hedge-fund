Let me analyze the project structure and understand its components. I'll need to:
1. Read the README.md first for any high-level documentation
2. Look at App-flow.md for understanding the application flow
3. Examine key Python files to understand their roles
4. Check the pyproject.toml for dependencies and project configuration

# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Market Data Analyst - Gathers and preprocesses market data
2. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
3. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
4. Technical Analyst - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
5. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
6. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7cd0f4c-3ca3-4e2e-addc-006bc31d76aa)

Note: the system simulates trading decisions, it does not actually trade.

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env

export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here' # Get a key from https://platform.openai.com/
export FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY='your-api-key-here' # Get a key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
```

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL
```

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --show-reasoning
```
You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 
```

### Running the Backtester

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL
```

**Example Output:**
```

                Your job is to make a trading decision based on the team's analysis while strictly adhering
                to risk management constraints.

                RISK MANAGEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
                - You MUST NOT exceed the max_position_size specified by the risk manager
                - You MUST follow the trading_action (buy/sell/hold) recommended by risk management
                - These are hard constraints that cannot be overridden by other signals

                When weighing the different signals for direction and timing:
                1. Fundamental Analysis (50% weight)
                   - Primary driver of trading decisions
                   - Should determine overall direction

                   - Secondary confirmation
                   - Helps with entry/exit timing
                
                3. Sentiment Analysis (15% weight)
                   - Final consideration
                   - Can influence sizing within risk limits
                
                The decision process should be:
                1. First check risk management constraints
                2. Then evaluate fundamental outlook
                3. Use technical analysis for timing

**Assistant:**

Based on my analysis of the project files, I can provide a detailed explanation of this AI hedge fund project's structure and components:

# Project Architecture

## Core Components

1. **Agent System (src/agents/)**
The project uses a multi-agent system with six specialized agents:

- **Market Data Agent** (market_data.py)
  - Entry point for data collection
  - Gathers and preprocesses market data
  - Feeds data to analysis agents

- **Analysis Agents**:
  - **Technical Analyst** (technicals.py): Analyzes technical indicators
  - **Fundamentals Agent** (fundamentals.py): Analyzes company fundamentals
  - **Sentiment Agent** (sentiment.py): Analyzes market sentiment
  
- **Decision Making Agents**:
  - **Risk Manager** (risk_manager.py): Sets position limits and risk constraints
  - **Portfolio Manager** (portfolio_manager.py): Makes final trading decisions
    - Weighs signals: Fundamentals (50%), Technical (35%), Sentiment (15%)
    - Enforces risk management constraints
    - Generates final buy/sell/hold orders

2. **Tools Layer (src/tools/)**
- **API Module** (api.py)
  - Interfaces with Financial Datasets API
  - Provides functions for:
    - Financial metrics retrieval
    - Price data fetching
    - Insider trading data
    - Market cap information

3. **Execution Components**
- **Main Entry Point** (src/main.py)
  - Implements the hedge fund trading system using LangGraph
  - Coordinates agent workflow
  - Handles command-line parameters

- **Backtester** (src/backtester.py)
  - Simulates trading strategy performance
  - Tracks portfolio metrics
  - Calculates performance indicators
  - Provides visualization capabilities

## Data Flow

1. Initial Data Collection:
   ```
   Market Data Agent → Raw Financial Data
   ```

2. Parallel Analysis:
   ```
   Raw Data → Technical Analysis
           → Fundamental Analysis
           → Sentiment Analysis
   ```

3. Decision Making:
   ```
   All Analyses → Risk Management → Portfolio Management → Final Decision
   ```

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: LangChain (v0.3.0) and LangGraph (v0.2.56)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas (^2.1.0), NumPy (^1.24.0)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib (^3.9.2)
- **Development Tools**: 
  - Poetry for dependency management
  - pytest for testing
  - black, isort, flake8 for code quality

## Key Features

1. **Trading Decision System**
   - Multi-agent architecture for diverse analysis
   - Weighted signal processing
   - Risk management constraints
   - Portfolio tracking

2. **Backtesting Capabilities**
   - Historical performance simulation
   - Portfolio value tracking
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - Trade execution validation

3. **Customization Options**
   - Configurable date ranges
   - Ticker symbol selection
   - Reasoning visibility toggle
   - API key configuration

## Usage

The system can be used in two primary modes:

1. **Live Analysis Mode**:
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL [--show-reasoning] [--start-date YYYY-MM-DD] [--end-date YYYY-MM-DD]
```

2. **Backtesting Mode**:
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL [--start-date YYYY-MM-DD] [--end-date YYYY-MM-DD]
```

## Documentation

- Primary documentation is in README.md
- Detailed workflow documentation in App-flow.md
- Code-level documentation in individual Python files
- Configuration examples in .env.example

## Important Note

This is an educational project and not intended for real trading. It includes appropriate disclaimers and is licensed under MIT License.

<thinking>
I should check if there's any additional documentation in the research directory that might provide more insights.

# Prompt list

## Main prompts

### Refined system prompt

```
from now on whenever i paste into a prompt, refine it into a more meaningful prompt that better achieves the end goal. put it in markdown, don't write anything else outside of it.
```

## Summarize prompt

### Origin

```
Usually, when you don't know what components a github project consists of, what kind of prompt should you write so that an LLM model (like claude or chatgpt for example) can help you understand the project structure and code flow? Put the answer prompt in markdown and don't put it in quotes, don't write anything outside of it.
```

### Refined version

```

What components does this GitHub project consist of, and how do they contribute to the overall structure and code flow? Provide a detailed explanation of the project’s structure, including directories, key files, and their roles. Highlight any relationships or dependencies between components, and explain how the code executes or interacts step-by-step. If the project includes documentation, point out where I can find more details.
