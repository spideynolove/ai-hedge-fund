# Project Requirements Document

## Overview
The AI Hedge Fund project is an educational system designed to simulate trading decisions using AI-powered agents. This project consists of data collection, multi-agent analysis, risk management, and decision-making components, with optional backtesting capabilities. The following outlines the requirements for implementing this system.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Data Collection
- **Market Data Agent**:
  - Retrieve financial datasets via API integration.
  - Validate and preprocess raw data.
  - Store data in a MongoDB database.
  - Cache results in Redis for quick access.

### Analysis Phase
- **Technical Analyst Agent**:
  - Analyze historical price patterns.
  - Generate technical indicators for decision-making.
- **Fundamentals Agent**:
  - Analyze company metrics such as revenue, profit, and ratios.
  - Generate signals based on company fundamentals.
- **Sentiment Agent**:
  - Extract market sentiment from news and social media.
  - Generate sentiment-based signals.

### Decision-Making
- **Risk Manager Agent**:
  - Apply position limits and enforce trading constraints.
  - Ensure adherence to risk management rules.
- **Portfolio Manager Agent**:
  - Aggregate signals using weighted contributions:
    - Fundamentals (50%)
    - Technical (35%)
    - Sentiment (15%)
  - Generate final trading actions: Buy/Sell/Hold.

### Backtesting
- Simulate strategies over historical data.
- Track portfolio metrics such as:
  - Total return
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Maximum drawdown
- Provide visualizations of performance.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Ensure efficient data collection and processing for real-time simulations.
- Minimize latency in agent communication and decision-making.

### Scalability
- Support multiple ticker symbols simultaneously.
- Enable scaling of analysis agents to handle large datasets.

### Security
- Secure API keys in environment variables.
- Ensure no sensitive financial decisions are executed live.

### Usability
- Provide clear command-line interface (CLI) options for:
  - Ticker symbol selection
  - Date range specification
  - Enabling/disabling reasoning visibility
- Include detailed error messages and logs for debugging.

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md for setup and usage instructions.
- Detailed "App-flow" file for understanding workflow.
- Inline code documentation for all modules and functions.

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python (>=3.9)
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - LangChain & LangGraph for agent architecture
  - Pandas and NumPy for data processing
  - Matplotlib for visualization
  - Python-dotenv for environment management

### Tools
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB for storing raw market data
  - Redis for caching results
- **Version Control**:
  - Git for source code management
- **Package Manager**:
  - Poetry for dependency management

## Installation and Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher installed.
- Poetry installed for dependency management.
- MongoDB and Redis servers set up and running.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
   cd ai-hedge-fund
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Add your API keys:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
     export FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY='your-financial-datasets-key'
     ```

## Testing and Validation

### Functional Testing
- Test data collection agents with mock API responses.
- Validate signal generation accuracy for all analysis agents.
- Verify adherence to risk constraints during decision-making.

### Performance Testing
- Measure agent response times under high data loads.
- Benchmark system throughput for multiple ticker simulations.

### Backtesting Validation
- Cross-verify backtesting results with known historical data.
- Ensure performance metrics match expected outcomes.

## Milestones and Deliverables

### Milestones
1. **Phase 1**: Complete core agent development.
2. **Phase 2**: Integrate decision-making workflow.
3. **Phase 3**: Implement and validate backtesting module.
4. **Phase 4**: Finalize documentation and usability features.

### Deliverables
- Fully functional AI hedge fund simulation system.
- Comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and workflows.
- Performance-tested backtesting module.

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure API data is consistent and accurate.
- **Overfitting**: Avoid reliance on specific historical patterns in backtesting.
- **System Scalability**: Address potential bottlenecks in high-frequency data processing.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement data validation pipelines.
- Use diverse datasets for testing and validation.
- Optimize agent communication and processing.

## Future Enhancements

### Feature Upgrades
- Add support for additional analysis agents (e.g., macroeconomic indicators).
- Enhance backtesting visualization with interactive dashboards.

### Deployment
- Enable real-time streaming data for continuous analysis.
- Develop a cloud-deployable architecture for scalability.
